                Hi! I'm a software engineering student at the University of Glasgow, eager to improve my coding
                abilities. Though I'm just starting, I'm committed to honing my skills and exploring new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have eight years of experience as an administrative assistant, which has equipped me with a strong
                foundation of organisational skills, attention to detail and work ethic. Beyond coding, I'm passionate
                about fitness, Muay Thai, and mental health advocacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the journey ahead in software development and look forward to connecting with others.

                    As a Peer Wellbeing Supporter at the University of Glasgow, I have completed specialized training to

                    to peers, adhere to strict confidentiality, and guide them to appropriate university services and
                    resources. I actively promote mental health awareness and support across the campus.

                    time management, and conducted regular check-ins to assess progress and well-being.
